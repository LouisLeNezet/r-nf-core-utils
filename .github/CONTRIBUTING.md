# `R nf-core/utils`: Contributing Guidelines

Hi there!
Many thanks for taking an interest in improving R nf-core/utils.

We try to manage the required tasks for R nf-core/utils using GitHub issues, you probably came to this page when creating one.
Please use the pre-filled template to save time.

However, don't be put off by this template - other more general issues and suggestions are welcome!
Contributions to the code are even more welcome ;)

> [!NOTE]
> If you need help using or modifying R nf-core/utils then the best place to ask is on the nf-core Slack [#nf-core-r-utils](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/nf-core-r-utils) channel ([join our Slack here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).

## Contribution workflow

If you'd like to write some code for R nf-core/utils, the standard workflow is as follows:

1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the [R nf-core/utils issues](https://github.com/nf-core/nf-core-r-utils/issues) to avoid duplicating work. If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [R nf-core/utils repository](https://github.com/nf-core/nf-core-r-utils) to your GitHub account
3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository
4. Submit a Pull Request against the `dev` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) or even their [excellent `git` resources](https://try.github.io/).

## Tests

You have the option to test your changes locally by running the unittests.
Execute all the tests with the following command:

```bash
rcmdcheck
```

When you create a pull request with changes, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will run automatic tests.
Typically, pull-requests are only fully reviewed when these tests are passing, though of course we can help out before then.

## Patch

:warning: Only in the unlikely and regretful event of a release happening with a bug.

- On your own fork, make a new branch `patch` based on `upstream/main` or `upstream/master`.
- Fix the bug, and bump version (X.Y.Z+1).
- Open a pull-request from `patch` to `main`/`master` with the changes.

## Getting help

For further information/help, please consult the R nf-core/utils vignettes and don't hesitate to get in touch on the nf-core Slack [#nf-core-r-utils](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/nf-core-r-utils) channel ([join our Slack here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).
